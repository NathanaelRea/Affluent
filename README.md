# Affluent

Affluent is a web app that helps you crunch the numbers on your finances. It’s got a cost-of-living (COL) calculator that adjusts for taxes (federal, state, city), shows COL-adjusted expenses, and more. There’s also a Monte Carlo simulation to figure out your safe withdrawal rate (SWR) for retirement planning.

**No data is transmitted** - everything runs locally in your browser. It’s just a calculator, no strings attached.
